## Collection reports fewer rows than expected

Tailpipe maintains collection state, so you'll only see new rows. If you want to reset and collect everything, you can delete `~/.internal/default/collection_state.db`. You might want to do this if you've built your own plugin, and if it's practical to recollect all the data.
