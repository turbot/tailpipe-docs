## Visualization

Tailpipe works with [Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io) which enables you to visualize query results. You can view and interactively explore [benchmarks](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl/benchmark), which bundle sets of [detections](docs/powerpipe-hcl/detection) that look for patterns in logs:

And you can view and explore [dashboards](https://powerpipe.io/docs/powerpipe-hcl/dashboard) that use charts and tables to summarize logs:

The [Powerpipe hub](https://hub.powerpipe.io?engines=tailpipe) provides [mods](https://powerpipe.io/docs/build) that you can download and use to visualize your logs in these ways.
