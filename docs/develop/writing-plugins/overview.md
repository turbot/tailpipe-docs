# Writing Plugins

The <a href="https://github.com/turbot/tailpipe-plugin-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailpipe Plugin SDK</a> makes writing tables fast, easy, and fun!  Most of the heavy lifting is taken care of for you â€” just define your tables, columns (schema struct) and how to map the data from your source, and you can start to query your logs with SQL!

While this documentation will provide an introduction and some examples, note that Tailpipe is an evolving, open source project. Please refer to the code as the authoritative source, as well as for real-world examples.

<!--Also, please try to be a good community citizen. Following the <a href="/docs/develop/standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standards</a> makes for a better, more consistent experience for end-users and developers alike.-->
