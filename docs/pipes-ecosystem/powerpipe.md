# Powerpipe

[Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io/) is an open-source platform that enables you to visualize logs and cloud infrastructure using   dashboards, log detections, and compliance controls.  Use it with [Tailpipe mods](https://hub.powerpipe.io?engines=tailpipe) that visualize logs on dashboards and benchmark them using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

<!--
