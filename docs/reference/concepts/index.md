# Concepts

These are the core Tailpipe concepts.

>[!NOTE]
> These began as Guides, but now proposes being in a new section, Reference/Concepts, that expands on a subset of the Glossary, so that Guides is reserved for the kinds of things covered in SP Guides. (Arrguably Steampipe could also have a Key Concepts section too, eg FDW, Plugins, Table, Workspace, these being a subset of its Glossary, but Tailpipe feels much more concept-heavy that SP.) I think I would want to know this stuff before going very far with Tailpipe. Where to put it is a separate question.
