# TAILPIPE_WORKSPACE

Sets the Tailpipe [workspace](/docs/reference/config-files/workspace). 

A Tailpipe `workspace` is a "profile" that allows you to define a unified environment with which the Tailpipe client can interact.

## Usage 
Use the `my_workspace` workspace:
```bash
export TAILPIPE_WORKSPACE=my_workspace
```
